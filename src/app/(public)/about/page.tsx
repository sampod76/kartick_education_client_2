            <p className="text-center leading-8 font-semibold">
              The story of iBlossomLearn began in the midst of the pandemic, a time when
              learning gaps widened, and traditional education methods were challenged.
              Recognizing the urgent need for a flexible and supportive learning
              environment, Sabah Kunle, with her 13 years of classroom experience and
              expertise in curriculum development, set out to create a solution. <br />
              Sabah envisioned an innovative educational platform that would cater to the
              diverse needs of homeschooling families. She founded iBlossomLearn, a
              top-tier private school, with a mission to offer a comprehensive and
              holistic curriculum. One of her standout creations was the Social and
              Emotional Learning (SEL) curriculum, designed specifically to support
              homeschooling families. This curriculum aimed to help students not only
              excel academically but also develop essential life skills and emotional
              resilience. <br />
              The introduction of Iblossomlearn P.DÂ Institute marked another milestone in
              this journey. This unique platform allowed students to access reading
              materials through engaging podcasts, perfect for listening while commuting
              or multitasking. It also provided a space for students to create and share
              their own audio stories, fostering creativity and enhancing their
              communication skills. <br />
              Sabah's Grammar & Literacy program was crafted to integrate literacy into
              skill acquisition seamlessly, ensuring students could achieve their highest
              potential. Her passion for education and her effective literacy framework
              inspired other educators to adopt her methods, leading to greater student
              engagement and success. <br />
              With iBlossomLearn, Sabah Kunle created a nurturing and adaptable learning
              environment that addressed the needs of the whole child. By focusing on both
              academic excellence and personal growth, iBlossomLearn equips students with
              the tools they need to thrive in an ever-changing world.

              experiences with other educators has led to many others
              implementing her literacy framework into their own classrooms to
              help engage their students in greater buy-ins as committed allies
