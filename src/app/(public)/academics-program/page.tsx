            We believe that a rigorous academic program combined with a supportive social
            and emotional curriculum leads to scholars’ success. We believe that this
            should not only happen in Brick N Mortar settings but also in homes with the
            support of family members. The iBLossomLearn curriculum reflects the best
            practices that are associated with such ideals for our scholars, while
            embracing their diverse backgrounds at every level. At iBlossomLearn, we not
            only allow students to work at their own pace but also address the needs of
            the whole child. Our partnership with each student is built on timely
            check-ins, reinforcing the material learned and providing continuous support.
            This approach nurtures both academic and social-emotional development. With
            the flexibility to advance at their own speed, students have the opportunity
            to complete our programs earlier while benefiting from a well-rounded
            educational experience that focuses on their overall growth.

              At iBlossomLearn, continuous assessment is integral to our approach,
              ensuring each student’s progress is closely monitored and supported. Our
              program includes regular check-ins where data-driven instruction is guided
              by assessments in core areas like Reading, Writing, and Math. Students
              undergo four interim assessments annually to measure progress towards
              grade-level standards. Personalized learning plans are developed based on
              assessment data, allowing students to work at their own pace while ensuring
              they meet or exceed academic goals. Additionally, standardized testing
              provides a comprehensive overview of student mastery and growth.
